# Daily Track

Drupal 8/9 custom module to display a Drupal block that has an audio player with a randomly selected track, changing daily.

Requires [Permanent Cache Bin](https://www.drupal.org/project/pcb) to isolate the day's track in its own cache and allow it to be expired independently of Drupal's main cache.
